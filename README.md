Secure peer to peer communication, opsec focused

### Motivation

- The need for information confidentiality
- Guarantee that the software does only what is intended
- No time to manually check the code of big open source projects
- No need for large communication protocols

### Philosophy/Goals

- Small codebase, easy to understand and hack
- Very simple layer on top of system calls and c standard libraries
- Secure by default
- Useful as a teaching/learning platform for linux system programming
- Small number of source files
- Minimal dependencies

### Development environment
